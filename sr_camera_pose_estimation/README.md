# sr_camera_pose_estimation

This is a package containing code necessary for calibrating camera pose in the scene with a marker.

## Overview

The idea of this method is to find a `root (usually robot base) -> camera` tranform when `camera -> marker` and `marker -> root` transforms are known. The general concept is described in the figure below:

</p>

In order to close the tf chain and find the calibration, as seen from the figure above, package needs to be provided three pieces of information:
- `root frame` - provided by a properly set scene or a [mock launch file](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_vision/blob/kinetic-devel/sr_camera_pose_estimation/launch/mock_world_transforms.launch) in this package
- `camera frame -> marker frame transform` - provided by [camera driver](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_vision/tree/kinetic-devel/sr_camera_launch) and [marker recognition](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_vision/tree/kinetic-devel/sr_marker_recognition) nodes
- `marker pose with respect to the root` - mocked or manually measured in the real scene

## Usage

In order to launch the calibration in a default mode run the following:

`roslaunch sr_camera_pose_estimation calibration.launch`

Before, make sure that camera driver and marker recognition are running (or call all launch files from one like in the [example launch](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_vision/blob/kinetic-devel/sr_camera_pose_estimation/launch/example_setup.launch) file).

Parameters available:

`marker_to_root_cartesian` - cartesian pose of the marker with respect to the root frame. The rotations in the frame are represented by [extrinsic rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles#Definition_by_extrinsic_rotations) of eurler angles. To properly set this value you need to know the coordinate frame of the markers, as described [here](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_vision/tree/kinetic-devel/sr_marker_recognition).

`marker_frame_name` - default (for alvar) *ar_marker_0*. This is a name of the marker frame that is positioned with respect to the root.

`root_frame_name` - default *ra_base_link*. Can be set to any static frame that is in the scene as long as the distance to the marker can be measured (or mocked).

`camera_frame_name` - default *camera_link*. Frame of the camera from which we want to know the final transform to the root frame.

Additional parameters:

`filtering` - default *true* (recommended). Running an moving average filter on the `camera -> marker` transform to reduce noisy data.

`window_width` - default *1000*. Window width for the moving average filter.

`continuous` - default *true*. Runs the camera pose estimation continuously (allowing movement of the camera while running the node). If set to *false*, calculates the pose only ones (removes the noise but camera needs to stay at the same pose until the next run of the calibration).

`output_static` - default "" (blank string). An optional file location to output a launch file that starts a static transform publisher containing the tf generated by the calibration.
## Example use

An example use of the package can be shown by running

`roslaunch sr_camera_pose_estimation example_setup.launch`

In this setup, following elements are used:

- real Kinect camera with depth registration,
- Alvar marker recognition in bundle depth mode,
- mock `world` and `ra_base_link` frames published using [this](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_vision/blob/kinetic-devel/sr_camera_pose_estimation/launch/mock_world_transforms.launch) launch file,
- [marker bundle](https://github.com/shadow-robot/common_resources/blob/kinetic-devel/sr_description_common/ar_markers/ar_marker_0_1_2_3_a4.xml) ([image here](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_vision/blob/kinetic-devel/sr_marker_recognition/doc/ar_marker_a4_border_right_size.png)) placed in the view of the camera.

After launching the nodes, following tf tree is obtained:

</p>

The scene can be investigated in rviz, where properly positioned frames and point cloud are present:

</p>

## troubleshooting
- Make sure that the camera driver is running and the marker or the bundle is recognized by the camera
- Make sure that the position and orientation of the marker are correct with respect to the root frame of your choice
